[h1]Changes and Additions[/h1]
[list]
[*] Unlocking Stellaris Evolved Tier 2 traditions can now be done with the traditions from EST too.
[*] Atm it won't show what each one will unlock, but hopefully in 3.2 it won't be needed.
[*] Added swaps for Machine Traders from Stellaris Evolved to Commerce allowing them to use it.
[*] Added support for the extra ethics for the Faith tradition finisher.
[*] Engineering Guildhall building now has job swaps for Machine Cult, and for hiveminds which use robots, allowing them to also get the assembly job and the building.
[*] Traditions blocked by aps (very few of them which are by default unlocked to either hives or machines) now also take into account the APs from Stellaris Evolved.
[*] Jobs are updated to use the wegiht modifiers from Evolved so no wierd issue about jobs that aren't worked will appear. Plus the jobs benefit either from some of the Evolved traits or civic or other effects.

For an amazing mod which adds so much more choice and makes unity more important.

For the suggested triggers and points to hook some of these changes allowing me to make this without having to overwrite too much.
